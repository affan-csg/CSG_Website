# E2E Tests - Career Source Group

End-to-end tests for critical user flows using Playwright.

## Setup

Playwright is installed and configured. No additional setup needed!

## Running Tests

### Run all tests (headless)

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Run tests with UI (interactive)

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

This opens Playwright's interactive test runner where you can see tests execute in real-time.

### Debug mode

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:debug
```

Opens browser with dev tools for step-by-step debugging.

### Run specific test file

```bash
pnpm test:e2e e2e/contact-form.spec.ts
```

### Run tests in headed mode (see browser)

```bash
pnpm test:e2e --headed
```

## Test Structure

Five spec files cover the site's critical flows:

- **`contact-form.spec.ts`** — Contact form (`/contact`) submission, validation, honeypot
- **`requirement-form.spec.ts`** — Get Started / client requirement form (`/get-started`)
- **`bench-form.spec.ts`** — Join Our Bench / candidate application form (`/join-our-bench`), including résumé upload
- **`regional-delivery.spec.ts`** — Global Delivery regional pages (`/global-delivery/$region`)
- **`staffing-navigation.spec.ts`** — Staffing hub and specialty page navigation (`/staffing/*`)

> As of 2026-08-13, `bench-form`, `regional-delivery`, and `staffing-navigation` have never been run against the current codebase — they were added in the same commit as the Supabase forms/route restructure but not yet executed. Run `pnpm test:e2e` and check the report before relying on them.

### contact-form.spec.ts (Test #1: Critical)

Tests the **Contact Form** submission flow on `/contact` page.

**Test Cases:**

1. ✅ Page loads with form elements
2. ✅ Empty form validation
3. ✅ Successful form submission → success message
4. ✅ Email format validation
5. ✅ Submit button disabled during submission
6. ✅ Form clears after success + ability to resend
7. ✅ Honeypot spam prevention field
8. ✅ Mobile viewport responsiveness

**What it validates:**

- Form elements render correctly
- Required field validation works
- Form submission succeeds and shows success message
- Form state management (clearing, resending)
- Spam prevention (honeypot field)
- Mobile responsiveness

**Key Assertions:**

```typescript
// Check form loads
await expect(page.locator('input[name="firstName"]')).toBeVisible();

// Fill form
await page.fill('input[name="firstName"]', "John");

// Submit
await page.locator('button[type="submit"]').click();

// Verify success
await expect(page.locator("text=/Message sent/i")).toBeVisible();
```

## How Tests Work

Each test:

1. **Setup** - Navigate to page and wait for load
2. **Action** - Interact with form (fill fields, click button)
3. **Assert** - Verify expected outcome (success message, validation, state change)

Example:

```typescript
test("should fill form and submit successfully", async ({ page }) => {
  // Setup - navigate to contact page
  await page.goto("/contact");

  // Action - fill form
  await page.fill('input[name="firstName"]', "John");
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', "john@example.com");

  // Action - submit
  await page.locator('button[type="submit"]').click();

  // Assert - verify success
  await expect(page.locator("text=/Message sent/i")).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Test Reports

After running tests, Playwright generates an HTML report:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
# Report opens automatically at: playwright-report/index.html
```

Reports show:

- ✅ Passed/failed tests
- 🎬 Video recordings of failures
- 📸 Screenshots at each step
- Timing and performance

## Browser Coverage

Tests run on:

- Chromium (Chrome)
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)
- Mobile Chrome (Pixel 5 mobile emulation)

This ensures form works across all major browsers and devices.

## CI/CD Integration

In your CI pipeline, add:

```yaml
- name: Run E2E tests
  run: pnpm test:e2e
```

Tests will:

- Retry failed tests twice automatically
- Run serially (one browser at a time) in CI
- Generate HTML report artifact
- Fail CI if any test fails

## Common Issues

### Tests fail to run

- Make sure dev server is running: `pnpm dev`
- Or let Playwright start it automatically (configured in `playwright.config.ts`)

### Form doesn't submit

- Check that Supabase env vars are set (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env.local`) — forms persist to Supabase, not email
- Review the server functions in `src/lib/form-actions.ts` and `src/lib/server/`

### Timeout waiting for success message

- Form submission might be failing silently
- Check browser console for errors: `pnpm test:e2e --headed`

## Next Steps

All five planned specs exist (see Test Structure above). What's left:

1. Run `pnpm test:e2e` and fix any failures surfaced against the current codebase
2. Wire the suite into CI so it runs on every PR
