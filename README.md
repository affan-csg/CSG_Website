## 🔐 Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (dev) or `.env.production` and fill in. Both are gitignored. See `.env.example` for the full, current list with inline comments — summary below:

```env
# Site
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=

# Supabase (required — form storage)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# Resend (optional — staff notification email)
RESEND_API_KEY=
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=
CONTACT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=

# Cloudflare Turnstile (bot protection on forms)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=

# Calendly (booking iframe)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDLY_URL=

# Analytics (leave disabled until ready)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_ID=

# Social links (leave empty to hide the footer icon)
NEXT_PUBLIC_LINKEDIN_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_URL=

# CRM sync (optional)
CRM_ENDPOINT_URL=
CRM_API_KEY=

# ATS sync (optional — not wired up yet, no ATS selected)
ATS_ENDPOINT_URL=
ATS_API_KEY=
```

Note: the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is kept for parity with existing tooling; Vite is configured (`vite.config.ts`) to bake in both `VITE_*` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prefixed vars identically for server and client bundles.

## 🚢 Deployment

This app builds via Nitro with the **Vercel** preset (`vite.config.ts`) and ships as a Vercel deployment — there is no standalone `start` script or self-hosted Node server.

1. **Set environment variables** in the Vercel project (mirror `.env.production`).
2. **Push to the connected branch** — Vercel builds and deploys automatically, or run `vercel --prod` locally with the Vercel CLI.
3. **Run Supabase migrations** against the production project (`supabase/migrations/*.sql`) before the first deploy that needs form storage.
4. **Test** — submit a form at `/get-started` and confirm it lands in Supabase (and email/CRM, if configured).
5. **Enable analytics post-launch** by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true` and redeploying.

**Full checklist:** See [LAUNCH_READY_STATUS.md](LAUNCH_READY_STATUS.md)
