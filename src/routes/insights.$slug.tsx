    content: `A bad hire costs more than just salary — here's how to identify and prevent costly hiring mistakes before they impact your bottom line.

The true cost of a bad hire goes far beyond the salary you pay. Studies show that a bad hire can cost a company 30% of that employee's first-year earnings. For a $100,000 salary, that's $30,000 lost in recruitment, training, and lost productivity.

## The Hidden Costs

When you factor in all the indirect costs, the impact becomes even more significant:

- Lost productivity during the hiring and training period
- Impact on team morale and culture
- Customer dissatisfaction and potential lost business
- Management time spent on performance issues
- Severance and outplacement costs

## How to Avoid Bad Hires

The key to avoiding bad hires is a structured, data-driven hiring process. Here's what works:

- Define clear role requirements before starting the search
- Use structured interviews with consistent questions
- Check references thoroughly
- Consider working with a staffing partner who specializes in your industry

## The Staffing Partner Advantage

Working with a specialized staffing partner like Career Source Group can significantly reduce the risk of bad hires. Our vetting process includes communication skills assessment, technical skill verification, and culture fit evaluation — before you ever see a resume.`,
