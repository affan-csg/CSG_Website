## NEXT STEPS (DevOps/Infrastructure)

1. **Set up production domain in Vercel**
   - Add `careersourcegroup.com` as a custom domain on the Vercel project
   - Vercel provisions and renews SSL automatically once DNS is pointed at it

2. **Deploy to production**
   - Set the env vars from `.env.production` in the Vercel project settings
   - Push to the connected branch (or `vercel --prod`) to deploy

3. **Quick test**
   - Load https://careersourcegroup.com
   - Submit test form via /get-started
   - Verify: Supabase saved data ✓ + email sent ✓ + HubSpot received ✓

4. **Launch!** 🚀
